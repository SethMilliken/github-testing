Apogee GiO USB Guitar Interface and Controller (Mac)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I picked up this GiO on ebay like-new and have used it moderately in my small, smoke-free home studio primarily for foot-controlled transport, and more occasionally for track and patch switching in Logic Pro. I have been quite happy with it. It has a satisfyingly hefty weight at a nice compact size, but still with enough space between switches that it doesn't feel cramped. The switches themselves are solidly constructed and provide a good amount of resistance&mdash;not too stiff, not too touchy. Worth noting, though, is that if you're going to be using it wearing socks, the more rounded stompbox buttons can be a little slippery.

As I built up my rig and added a lot more gear, I found myself wanting much more sophisticated switching capabilities as well as more versatile MIDI control, so I recently upgraded to a GCX and Ground Control. As much as I like the GiO, there just isn't enough room on the floor of my small space to accommodate it anymore. If you have more modest needs, you'll not likely find fault with the GiO.

The GiO is powered by USB, and setting it up is simple and straightforward. Apogee has done a great job of making the experience of using the GiO effortless. I recommend that you read the PDF [User's Guide](http://www.apogeedigital.com/pdf/gio_usersguide.pdf) as well as the [FAQs](http://www.apogeedigital.com/gio-support-faqs.php) for the specs and to become familiar with all of its capabilities and some of its limitations. The driver can be downloaded [here](http://www.apogeedigital.com/drivers/GiO_July_2011.dmg).

As you can see in the photos, there are a couple of superficial blemishes where the paint got scraped during normal use. Even though I suspect you're unlikely to be mounting this footswitch in a display case, I wanted to be as thorough and accurate as possible in my description.

If you're considering a GiO, you probably already know this, but just to be clear: *this product works only with Mac OS X*. Moreover, it is expressly designed to work with Logic Pro, MainStage, and Garageband (which it does quite well). Nevertheless, it does send MIDI Control Change messages (documented in the [FAQs](http://www.apogeedigital.com/gio-support-faqs.php)), so it can also be used as a more general MIDI control device, and with programs like Ableton Live and ProTools. Note, however, that the messages for controlling the status lights are _not_ documented.

Includes stock USB and 1/4" stereo to dual-RCA cables. Original box.

Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. It would make me happy to know this great kit was going to someone who will delight in making good use of it.
